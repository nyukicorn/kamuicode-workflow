Create a short jazz melody with golden sunset atmosphere. Include smooth saxophone leads, gentle piano accompaniment, soft brush drums, and warm double bass. Use medium swing tempo (90-100 BPM) with nostalgic, dreamy, and romantic emotions. Style should be smooth jazz with classic evening ambiance. Keep it brief and intro-like for a 35-second duration.
