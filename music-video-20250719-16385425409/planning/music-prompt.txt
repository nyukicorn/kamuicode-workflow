Create a short 30-40 second elegant harp composition inspired by the beauty of a blooming rose. The music should be romantic and graceful, featuring delicate harp arpeggios that flow like silk petals. Begin with a gentle intro showcasing the harp's crystalline tones, build to an emotional crescendo that captures the rose's passionate beauty, then conclude with a soft, lingering outro. The tempo should be moderate and contemplative, with rich harmonies that evoke luxury and refinement. Include subtle dynamic variations that mirror the gentle sway of rose petals in a soft breeze. Style: Classical crossover, cinematic, romantic. Instruments: Solo harp with subtle string accompaniment. Mood: Elegant, romantic, sophisticated, dreamy.
