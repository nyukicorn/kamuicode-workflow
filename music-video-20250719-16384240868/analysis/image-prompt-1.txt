A sophisticated classical music performance scene with elegant orchestral elements, featuring warm golden and deep blue lighting that creates a cinematic atmosphere. The composition should include rich textures like polished wood instruments, flowing silk fabrics, and ornate architectural details in a concert hall setting. Use dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with soft shadows and highlights that emphasize luxury and refinement. The color palette should be sophisticated with deep burgundy, golden amber, and midnight blue tones. Include subtle motion blur effects suggesting graceful movement and musical flow, with bokeh background lights creating depth and elegance. Add delicate metallic glints from harp strings and piano keys to reflect the gentle arpeggios, with contemplative and serene atmosphere matching the 75-85 BPM tempo, suitable for a high-end classical crossover music video optimized for seamless looping and foundational 50-60% timeline coverage.
