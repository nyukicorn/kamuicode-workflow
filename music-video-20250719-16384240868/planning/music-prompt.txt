Create a short 30-40 second classical crossover intro featuring elegant orchestral strings as the foundation, accompanied by gentle piano melodies and subtle modern electronic elements. The composition should build from a quiet, contemplative opening to a moderately powerful climax before settling into a graceful conclusion. Use a moderate tempo around 75-85 BPM with cinematic quality and emotional depth suitable for a sophisticated music video. Include delicate harp arpeggios, warm string harmonies, and light percussion accents to create an uplifting yet refined atmosphere.
