Create a short atmospheric track featuring gentle rain sounds layered with soft acoustic guitar fingerpicking. The piece should be introspective and peaceful, with a slow tempo around 60-70 BPM. Include subtle reverb on the guitar to create space, while maintaining the intimate feel of raindrops. The composition should build gradually from minimal rain and single guitar notes to a fuller soundscape, then return to simplicity. Style: ambient folk, neo-classical guitar. Duration: short intro piece, approximately 30-40 seconds.
