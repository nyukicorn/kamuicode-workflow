Create a romantic piano ballad with soft orchestral accompaniment featuring string ensemble and harp. The music should evoke the elegance and beauty of a perfect rose bouquet with gentle, flowing melody at 70-80 BPM. Include subtle violin solos, warm harmonic progressions in major keys, and delicate crescendos that mirror the blooming of roses. Style should be contemporary classical with cinematic qualities, creating an intimate atmosphere perfect for romantic scenes. Duration should be short intro piece, approximately 30-40 seconds.
