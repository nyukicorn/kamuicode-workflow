# Three.js Experience: 改善版3Dバラ形状テスト - 離散花びら構造の評価

A Three.js interactive 3D experience featuring an improved 3D rose shape test with discrete petal structure evaluation.

## Experience Concept

This experience implements an enhanced 3D rose visualization using Three.js, focusing on discrete petal structure evaluation. The rose geometry is constructed with mathematical precision to create realistic flower petals arranged in natural patterns.

## Controls

- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate and navigate around the 3D scene
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in and out
- **Double-click**: Toggle auto-rotate mode

## Technical Requirements

- **Three.js**: Modern 3D graphics library
- **WebGL**: Required for hardware-accelerated rendering
- **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge with WebGL support

## Features

- Interactive 3D rose with discrete petal geometry
- Panoramic background environment
- Audio accompaniment with generated music
- Smooth camera controls and animations
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Usage

Simply open `src/index.html` in a modern web browser with WebGL support. The experience will load automatically with the 3D rose scene ready for interaction.
