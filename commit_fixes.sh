# Create the commit with the detailed message
git commit -m "Fix video and music merge issue in original workflow

ðŸ”§ Fixes:
- Add FFmpeg installation for audio processing
- Add Node.js/SDK setup for Claude Code execution
- Improve FFmpeg commands with specific parameters
- Simplify prompt for better success rate
- Use -stream_loop -1 and -shortest for proper audio sync

ðŸŽ¯ This should resolve the issue where videos and music were not merging properly and not appearing on GitHub Pages.
