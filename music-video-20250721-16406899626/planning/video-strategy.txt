VIDEO 1 (MAIN-60%): Gentle flowing abstract geometric patterns with subtle rotation, seamless loop design, stable central composition, slow organic movement perfect for 0.8-1.2x speed scaling, minimal particle drift suggesting data processing, soft transitions between blue-white gradients, optimized for continuous background role throughout 30-40s music. VIDEO 2 (ACCENT-25%): Dynamic particle streams with periodic intensity pulses, responsive to musical beats, faster geometric transformations, designed for strategic placement during musical transitions, supports 0.6-1.4x speed variations, enhanced contrast for attention-grabbing moments, overlay-friendly with transparency zones. VIDEO 3 (TRANSITION-15%): High-energy geometric morphing with rapid pattern evolution, sharp contrasts and bold movements, optimized for 1.0-2.0x speed, concentrated visual impact for musical climax, strong directional flow for transition effects, overlay capabilities for composite layering during peak moments
