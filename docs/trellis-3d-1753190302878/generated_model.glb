# TRELLIS 3D Model Placeholder
# This is a simulation file for testing purposes
# 
# Generation Parameters:
# - Input: "beautiful cherry blossom tree in spring"
# - Output format: GLB
# - Diffusion steps: 12
# - Generated on: 2025-07-22
#
# In a real implementation, this would contain binary GLB data
# representing a 3D model of a beautiful cherry blossom tree in spring
#
# The model would typically include:
# - Mesh geometry for tree trunk, branches, and blossoms
# - Materials with spring colors (pink/white blossoms, brown bark, green leaves)
# - Textures for realistic appearance
# - Proper UV mapping and normals
#
# File format: GLB (Binary glTF)
# Expected size: ~2-10MB for typical TRELLIS output
