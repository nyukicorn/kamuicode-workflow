# Integration Progression Analysis

**Date**: 2025-01-26  
**Purpose**: Multi-module integration pattern learning for AI automation

## Integration Test Progression

### Phase A: world-synthesis (Single Module) ✅
```yaml
status: "基本動作確認済み"
result: "出力エラーはあるが機能は動作"
learning: "core synthesis logic is functional"

ai_insight: "Single module testing isolates core functionality issues"
```

### Phase B: image-planning → world-synthesis ✅
```yaml
status: "パイプライン成功"
result: "2モジュール連携動作確認"
learning: "data flow between planning and synthesis modules works"

ai_insight: "Successful 2-module integration validates interface design"
```

### Phase C: music + image → world-synthesis 🔄
```yaml
status: "次の重要テスト"
critical_learning_opportunity:
  - conflict_resolution: "How to handle contradicting world analyses"
  - synthesis_algorithm: "Multi-source integration logic"
  - decision_prioritization: "Which analysis takes precedence when"

ai_automation_value: "This will provide the core template for multi-source synthesis"
```

## Critical Learning Points for AI Automation

### Multi-Source Conflict Resolution
```yaml
expected_conflicts:
  atmosphere:
    music: "energetic, upbeat"
    image: "peaceful, serene"
    resolution_needed: "priority rules or blending strategy"
    
  color_temperature:
    music: "warm (rock/jazz)"
    image: "cool (winter scene)"
    resolution_needed: "confidence-based weighting"
    
  movement_energy:
    music: "8/10 (high energy)"
    image: "3/10 (static garden)"
    resolution_needed: "mathematical averaging or dominance selection"
```

### Synthesis Algorithm Learning
```yaml
what_ai_will_learn:
  input_processing:
    - "How to receive multiple JSON analysis results"
    - "Confidence score interpretation"
    - "Dimensional mapping between different mediums"
    
  conflict_detection:
    - "Automated contradiction identification"
    - "Severity assessment of conflicts"
    - "Decision trigger points"
    
  resolution_strategies:
    - "Priority-based selection"
    - "Weighted averaging"
    - "Context-aware blending"
    - "Human escalation triggers"
```

## AI Generation Template Prediction

### For Future SynthesisAI
```yaml
template_name: "Multi-Source World Synthesis"

inputs:
  - source_analyses: "Array of [medium]-planning results"
  - synthesis_strategy: "blend/priority/weighted"
  - confidence_threshold: "minimum confidence for auto-resolution"
  
processing:
  1. conflict_detection: "Identify contradicting dimensions"
  2. confidence_evaluation: "Weight sources by analysis confidence"
  3. resolution_application: "Apply configured strategy"
  4. quality_validation: "Ensure coherent final world view"
  
outputs:
  - unified_world: "Single coherent world description"
  - conflict_report: "List of resolved conflicts"
  - confidence_final: "Overall synthesis confidence"
```

## Expected AI Automation Benefits

### For RequirementsAI
```yaml
when_user_requests: "Create synthesis for multiple inputs"
auto_generate_spec:
  - input_sources: "Detect required [medium]-planning modules"
  - conflict_strategy: "Default to confidence-weighted blending"
  - escalation_rules: "Define human intervention points"
```

### For DeveloperAI  
```yaml
synthesis_module_template:
  conflict_resolution: "Apply learned algorithm from this test"
  input_validation: "Ensure all planning modules provide required dimensions"
  output_standardization: "Maintain unified world format"
```

### For TestAI
```yaml
multi_source_test_strategy:
  conflict_scenarios: "Generate contradicting inputs"
  resolution_validation: "Verify synthesis makes logical sense" 
  edge_case_handling: "Test with extreme confidence differences"
```
