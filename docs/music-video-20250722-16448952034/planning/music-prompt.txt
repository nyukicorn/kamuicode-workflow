Create a short beautiful music box melody inspired by rose flowers. Use delicate music box instruments with gentle plucking and soft metallic tones at 70 BPM in C major. The composition should evoke elegance, love, and nostalgia with a dreamy, romantic atmosphere. Include soft intro, flowing main melody about blooming roses, emotional climax, and gentle fade-out ending. Duration should be brief, around 30-40 seconds maximum for a short musical piece intro.
