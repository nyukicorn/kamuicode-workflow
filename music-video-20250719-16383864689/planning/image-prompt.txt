A serene acoustic music scene with warm golden hour lighting, featuring a vintage acoustic guitar resting against a rustic wooden chair in a cozy corner. Soft natural light streaming through a window, creating gentle shadows. Warm color palette with golden yellows, soft browns, and cream tones. Intimate indoor setting with subtle textures like worn wood, soft fabric, and delicate details. Peaceful, nostalgic atmosphere with shallow depth of field and dreamy bokeh effects. Style: cinematic, emotional, and contemplative.
