Create a short 35-second acoustic pop ballad with gentle fingerpicked acoustic guitar, soft piano accompaniment, and warm vocals. Tempo around 70 BPM in C major. Emotional and nostalgic atmosphere with a structure: intro (4s) - verse (12s) - chorus (12s) - outro (7s). Include subtle string pads and light percussion. Style should be intimate, heartfelt, and perfect for a contemplative music video. Short intro with single guitar, building to full arrangement in chorus, then gentle fade out.
