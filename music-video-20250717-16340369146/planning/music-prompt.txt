Create a short, beautiful music box melody inspired by roses. The piece should be 30-40 seconds long with delicate, nostalgic tones. Use music box, piano, and gentle strings. Tempo should be slow and graceful at 70-80 BPM in F major. Include a brief intro, main melodic section with romantic flourishes, and a gentle fade-out ending. The music should evoke the elegance of blooming roses with crystalline, fairy-tale-like quality. Keep it concise and emotionally touching.
