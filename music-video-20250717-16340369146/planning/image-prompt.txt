A stunning close-up of a deep red rose in full bloom, with velvet-soft petals catching golden sunlight. The rose sits elegantly in an ornate vintage music box with intricate brass details and tiny mechanical gears visible. Soft bokeh background in warm cream and rose tones. Cinematic lighting with gentle shadows. The composition should evoke romance, nostalgia, and fairy-tale elegance. Rich textures, delicate details, and a dreamy atmospheric quality that matches the beauty of a music box melody.
