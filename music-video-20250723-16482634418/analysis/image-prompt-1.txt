A dreamy, romantic scene of blooming roses in soft pastel colors, featuring delicate pink and cream-colored rose petals with gentle morning light filtering through them. The composition should have a music box aesthetic with vintage, nostalgic elements like soft golden bokeh effects and ethereal atmosphere. Include subtle golden metallic sparkles and crystalline light reflections floating around the roses, creating a fairytale-like ambiance with delicate mechanical beauty reminiscent of music box craftsmanship. The overall mood should be peaceful, elegant, and romantic with soft, warm lighting that evokes the gentle melody of a music box at 62-68 BPM rhythm. Style: soft focus photography with dreamy, cinematic quality and pastel color palette enhanced with metallic luminescence.
