Create a beautiful short music box melody inspired by roses, featuring delicate and elegant music box tones with a gentle, nostalgic atmosphere. The piece should be instrumental only, with a slow to moderate tempo (60-80 BPM), capturing the essence of blooming roses - graceful, pure, and emotionally touching. Include subtle harmonic progressions that evoke feelings of beauty, peace, and gentle nostalgia. The music should have a clear intro, melodic development, emotional climax, and peaceful outro, perfect for a short 30-40 second composition. Style: romantic music box, classical influence, ambient undertones, no vocals, pristine crystal-clear audio quality.
