Create a short 30-40 second sophisticated night cafe jazz piece featuring warm piano melodies, smooth upright bass lines, subtle brush drums, and gentle tenor saxophone. The composition should evoke the intimate atmosphere of a dimly lit urban coffee shop after midnight, with moderate tempo around 100 BPM. Include a brief piano intro, full ensemble development, a tasteful saxophone solo climax, and a gentle fade-out ending. Style should be modern jazz with vintage warmth, perfect for a contemplative evening mood.
