Cinematic view of an intimate night cafe with warm amber lighting, vintage leather chairs, and steaming coffee cups on dark wooden tables. Soft golden illumination from pendant lamps creates atmospheric shadows. Rain droplets streak the large windows reflecting neon city lights. A silhouette of a saxophone player visible in the background corner. Moody film noir aesthetic with rich burgundy and amber color palette, shallow depth of field, professional cinematography style.
