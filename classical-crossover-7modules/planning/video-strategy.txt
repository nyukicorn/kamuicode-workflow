Quick focus pulls between string instruments and pianist hands. More energetic camera movement with intentional motion blur for climactic moments. Designed for 1.5-2x speed playback during musical peaks. Should work effectively in 20-30% of total duration. Video 3 (Transition): Flowing fabric movements and bokeh light transitions. Smooth tracking shots connecting different areas of the performance space. Silk curtains or flowing elements creating natural transition effects. Optimized for speed variations and overlay blending. Supporting 10-20% of timeline with connector functionality.
