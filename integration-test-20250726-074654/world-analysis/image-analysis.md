- **Analysis Target**: "A mystical underground crystal cave with glowing purple crystals, dramatic lighting, deep caverns"
- **Analysis Confidence**: 87%

## Basic World Characteristics

### Scene Classification
- **Scene Type**: Dramatic
  - **Reasoning**: The combination of underground setting, glowing crystals, and dramatic lighting creates a highly theatrical and visually striking environment that demands attention.

### Atmospheric Profile
- **Atmosphere**: Mysterious
  - **Reasoning**: Underground crystal caves evoke wonder, unknown depths, and hidden secrets. The mystical aspect reinforces this mysterious quality.

### Depth Configuration
- **Depth Mode**: Enhanced
  - **Reasoning**: Deep caverns with crystal formations naturally create significant depth layers and spatial complexity that benefit from enhanced depth processing.

### Lighting Analysis
- **Lighting Style**: Dramatic
  - **Reasoning**: The prompt explicitly mentions "dramatic lighting" combined with glowing crystals, indicating strong contrast and theatrical illumination effects.

### Movement Assessment
- **Movement Energy**: 4/10
  - **Reasoning**: Crystal caves are inherently static environments, but the glowing effect and dramatic lighting suggest subtle energy and visual interest.

### Color Profile
- **Color Temperature**: Cool
  - **Reasoning**: Purple crystal glow and underground environment typically skew toward cooler color temperatures, creating an otherworldly feel.

## Extended World Characteristics

### Spatial Properties
- **Perspective Depth**: Deep
  - **Reasoning**: "Deep caverns" explicitly indicates significant depth layers and receding perspectives ideal for immersive experiences.

- **Subject Distance**: Medium
  - **Reasoning**: Crystal formations would be positioned at mid-range distances to allow appreciation of both detail and overall cave structure.

- **Environmental Scale**: Vast
  - **Reasoning**: Underground cavern systems suggest large-scale environments that create sense of exploration and immersion.

### Dynamic Properties
- **Implied Movement**: Still
  - **Reasoning**: Crystal formations and cave structures are static, though glowing effects may create subtle visual animation.

- **Visual Complexity**: Moderate
  - **Reasoning**: Crystal formations and lighting effects create visual interest without overwhelming complexity.

- **Composition Balance**: Stable
  - **Reasoning**: Cave environments with crystal formations typically follow natural geological composition patterns.

### Cultural and Artistic Context
- **Artistic Style**: Realistic
  - **Reasoning**: Mystical crystal caves are best rendered with realistic detail to maximize immersive impact.

- **Cultural Context**: Western
  - **Reasoning**: Fantasy crystal cave imagery aligns with Western fantasy and adventure aesthetics.

- **Time Period**: Contemporary
  - **Reasoning**: Mystical crystal caves represent timeless, fantasy environments suitable for modern immersive experiences.

### Technical Properties
- **Image Quality**: Hi-fi
  - **Reasoning**: Crystal formations and dramatic lighting effects require high-quality rendering to achieve proper visual impact.

- **Artistic Processing**: Natural
