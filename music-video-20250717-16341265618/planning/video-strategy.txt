Video 1 (Main Theme - 50-60% usage): Create a slow, elegant zoom-in movement from wide shot to medium shot of the red rose, emphasizing the overall beauty and perfect symmetry. Camera movement should be perfectly smooth and cyclical, starting and ending at the same position for seamless looping. Speed: 0.8-1.2x variable. Focus on gentle rotation and subtle zoom for hypnotic effect that works at any playback speed.

Video 2 (Climax Accent - 20-30% usage): Generate dynamic close-up of rose petals with dramatic lighting changes and dewdrop reflections catching light. Include subtle particle effects or light rays filtering through petals. Camera should capture the intricate petal texture with slight movements that emphasize depth and dimensionality. Optimized for 0.7-1.5x speed variations and overlay effects.

Video 3 (Transition Element - 10-20% usage): Produce ethereal scene of rose petals gently falling or floating, with soft focus transitions and natural fade-in/fade-out properties. Design for smooth transitions between other videos, with organic movement that complements rather than competes. Perfect for speed ramping (0.5-2x) and blend mode applications in post-production.
