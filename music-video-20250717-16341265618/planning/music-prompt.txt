Create a short cinematic neo-classical composition with electronic ambient elements, 35 seconds duration, inspired by a red rose with detailed petals. Begin with gentle solo piano melody at 65 BPM, gradually introduce warm string ensemble and subtle synthesizer pads. The music should evoke the delicate beauty of rose petals unfurling, with emotional crescendo at 20-25 seconds featuring layered strings and soft percussion. Include gentle dynamic transitions that mirror the organic growth of a blooming flower. End with piano solo and ambient fade. Romantic, elegant, and deeply emotional with crystal-clear production quality.
